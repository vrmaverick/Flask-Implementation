## Introduction
Welcome to the Flask Implementation project!, How to implement Flask if Windows restricts it with a basic example.

The Examples show how we can route between different HTML files and can also implement properties of JS.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.4 
- Flask

```bash
#on PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
This is temporary once done with Flask we can set it back to restricted

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vrmaverick/Flask_Implementation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Flask_Implementation

```

Once in the directory

```bash
# For Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```bash
#install Flask
python -m pip install Flask
```

```bash
Set the object to the main file
$env : Flask_APP = "<name_of your_file>.py"
$env : Debug = True #for auto update after changing
flask run
```
